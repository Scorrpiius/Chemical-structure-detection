# Chemical-structure-detection
A code I wrote as part of my internship in the LIRIS. The objective of the internship was to detect chemical structures in degradation patterns and from that get the filiation between the molecules. It would simplify the hard process of "manual" detection and be used to analyse more images than a person could.
